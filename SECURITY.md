The Value of External Support in Internal Audits

A. Partnering with Third-Party Auditing Firms
While internal audit teams provide invaluable insights into an organization’s operations, partnering with third-party auditing firms can offer additional layers of expertise and objectivity. These external partners bring a fresh perspective, specialized knowledge, and advanced tools that can enhance the effectiveness of fraud detection efforts.

Enhanced Expertise and Specialization: Third-party auditing firms often possess specialized knowledge and experience in detecting complex fraud schemes that may be outside the purview of internal teams. They bring industry-specific expertise and advanced methodologies that can uncover fraud more efficiently.
Objectivity and Unbiased Analysis: External firms can offer an unbiased assessment of the organization’s internal controls and processes. Their objectivity is crucial in identifying areas of improvement without the potential conflicts of interest that might arise within internal teams.
Access to Advanced Tools and Technologies: Many third-party auditing firms have access to cutting-edge data analytics tools and technologies that can provide deeper insights and more accurate fraud detection. Leveraging these resources can significantly enhance the organization’s ability to detect and prevent fraud.
B. Ensuring Independence and Objectivity
The independence and objectivity provided by third-party auditing firms are essential in maintaining the integrity of the audit process. Organizations must ensure that these firms operate with complete autonomy to deliver honest and transparent findings.
## Security

GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to opensource-security@github.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
